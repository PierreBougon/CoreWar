ASM part is a compiler which "translate" asm langage to binary.\n
Virtual machine takes those binaries and run them.

--------

## ASM

You can find some source code of asm here : /champion/src

It'll transform those .s in .cor that can be interpreated by the machine.


You can create your own champ to make him fight against others champs.

--------

## VM

The machine will run your champion and the others to make them fight each others.

You're champion need to say 'I'm alive' with the 'live' instruction each CYCLE_TO_DIE


The winner is the last program still alive.
